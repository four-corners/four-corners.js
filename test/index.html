Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York agreed with the plaintiffs, finding on Tuesday that “hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of people will go uncounted in the census if the citizenship question is included…That undercount, in turn, will translate into a loss of political power and funds, among other harms, for various Plaintiffs.”\n\nThe census determines how $675 billion in federal funding is allocated, how much representation states receive, and how political districts are drawn. “Given the stakes, the interest in an accurate count is immense,” Furman wrote in his 277-page opinion. “Even small deviations from an accurate count can have major implications for states, localities, and the people who live in them—indeed, for the country as a whole.”","media":[{"type":"youtube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66uYgZ0Jaro","caption":"PBS NewsHour"}]},"context":{"text":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) has been conducting drills in Nogales similar to the ones that took place before San Ysidro was closed, and locals have warned CBP that a similar shutdown could have &lsquo;catastrophic&rsquo; consequences for the region.\n\nSuch consequences are largely economic: the interdependent lifestyle in border towns means local businesses are especially vulnerable to the president&apos;s provocations.\n\n4.9 million people live in the Tijuana-San Diego region, which has been a hub for cross-border commerce and tourism for more than a century. During prohibition, Americans headed south in search of easy access to alcohol. Nowadays some still head to Tijuana for booze, but they also seek inexpensive healthcare and prescription drugs.\n\nAt times, it seems there are as many cars in the city with California license plates as with those for the surrounding Baja California. In the touristy downtown, dollars are accepted like pesos and English is a constant.\n\nTijuana dentist Oved Téllez said the temporary border closure could have long-term consequences for his business.\n\n&lsquo;Most of our patients that come from the US [but] they don&apos;t want to come anymore because they are not certain about what&apos;s going to happen on the border when they are here,&rsquo; Tellez said. &lsquo;They are afraid that when they come the border will close again.&rsquo;\n\nGuerrero, of Alliance San Diego, warned Trump&apos;s aggressive tactics at the border have been introduced with no thought of the realities of people who live, work, play and pray on both sides of the border.\n\nGuerrero said: &lsquo;The president is playing a brinksman game and he&apos;s doing it using real people, real lives, real consequences as game pieces.&rsquo;","media":[{"type":"image","url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa06488c4757b267f6c6c96f27da476f97ac1ade/0_130_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1920&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=adfe866d19eb26e25a35fd62d0cddf56","credit":"A US military helicopter flies past a pedestrian bridge after the closing of the United States-Mexico border south of San Diego, California.
