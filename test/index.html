Wow, is that pretty!” Anders exclaimed, before photographing it, first in black and white, and then again in color. “We set out to explore the moon and instead discovered the Earth,” he later wrote.nnEarthrise, as the photograph was called, was placed on a U.S. postage stamp and is credited with inspiring Earth Day, celebrated for the first time by millions on April 22, 1970, sixteen months after Anders made the image."},"imagery":{"media":[{"source":"youtube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu7NUQEHfe4","caption":"Earthrise: The Story Behind William Anders' Apollo 8 Photograph","credit":"Time Magazine","index":0},{"source":"image","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Scott_1371%2C_Apollo_8.jpg","caption":"United States postage stamp (Scott #1371) celebrating Apollo 8, the first manned mission to orbit the Moon.
