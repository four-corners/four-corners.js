Others dispute that enough housing has been built, so it remains to be seen if the city will actually be able to continue enforcement.","media":[]},"links":{"links":[{"title":"Laws Related to Homelessness in Los Angeles","url":"http://la.lawsoup.org/legal-guides/laws-by-topic/homelessness/"}]}}'></div>
