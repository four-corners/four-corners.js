Zhao, a recent law graduate, said she was intrigued by the websites and mobile apps aimed at single people looking to hire an instant partner whom they can present to relatives during the new year holidays. During the holidays, single men and women are often subjected to lectures from family members keen on reinforcing the importance of marriage and securing the family bloodline. Some singles resort to hiring fake girlfriends and boyfriends through date-for-hire apps and websites. Zhao said in her online advertisement that she wanted the experience of being a holiday companion and would only charge for the transportation to the person&apos;s home town. From a pool of 700 responses, Zhao chose Wang Quanming, a website operator in his early thirties from the rural south. \"He is being pressured to find a wife and his need to rent a girlfriend is real,\" Zhao told me when I approached her and Wang after seeing the online ad and learning about their agreement. Then I accompanied the couple for the duration of the trip.","bio":"Muyi Xiao is currently the Visuals Editor at ChinaFile, an online magazine published by the Center on U.S.-China Relations at Asia Society, dedicated to broaden its readers’ understanding of China and to spark new conversation about China’s place in the world.

Overcrowding and heavy winter rains left the facilities at Benito Juarez uninhabitable and its residents were relocated to a more suitable location on the city outskirts (which was, not coincidentally, much further from the U.S.-Mexico border.) The possessions and detritus left behind speak to the displacement and loss experienced by the migrants, who left behind their families and homelands in hopes of better lives in the U.S."},"imagery":{},"links":{},"opts":{},"lang":"en"}'><img class='fc-img' src='http://i67.tinypic.com/25jcdv8.jpg'/></div> -->
