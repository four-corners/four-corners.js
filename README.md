# fourcorners.js

The **Four Corners Project** allows specific information to be embedded in each of the photographâ€™s four corners, where it is available for an interested reader to explore. This increased contextualization strengthens both the authorship of the photographer and the credibility of the image.

**fourcorners.js** is an open source JavaScript library to initiate your Four Corners photographs built on fourcornersproject.org or generated via your CMS. The library is still in development and should not be used in production.

For inquiries about usage or development contribution, please email [fourcornersphotograph@gmail.com](mailto:fourcornersphotograph@gmail.com).
